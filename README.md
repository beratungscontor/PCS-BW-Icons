## What is this about?
Custom library for PCS SAP BW Icons in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), based on [SAP Business Technology Platform Solution Diagrams & Icons](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=477829554).

The goal is a **SAP Business Warehouse Icon Library** to support visualization of data model. Therefore you can link your Draw.io (Diagrams.net) with cloud-based applications or like in this case â€“ with your Github repository.

A first version is already build and operational:

## How to Contribute to the Project

The library is not yet complete. As mentioned you can customize your own lib when you work within your local environment. To improve the Github repository and in particular the Repository for SAP Business Warehouse Icons for data modelling in Draw.io you can contribute by adding and updating new or existing Icons for Business Warehouse context.

- git clone https://github.com/beratungscontor/PCS-BW-Icons.git
- In Draw.io add the libraries from the local folder which you have cloned before
- Modify or add icons
- Create Pull Request

In order to maintain the function of the search-engine in Draw.io please pay attention and assign reasonable object names when you create Icons (e.g. for Data-Store-Object advanced: "ADSO")

You can find a blank template without any preloaded libraries under:

```Powershell
https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&clibs=U
```
